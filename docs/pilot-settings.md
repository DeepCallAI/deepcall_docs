# DeepCall Pilot Settings Page Guide

The Settings page allows you to manage your user account and your team during the pilot. It is divided into two sections: **Your Profile** and **User Management**.

---

## 👤 Your Profile

This section allows you to update your personal account settings.

### Features

- **Change Full Name**  
  You can update the display name associated with your account.

- **Change Password**  
  You can change your account password directly from this page.

> Note: Your user role (Admin or Viewer) is not displayed in this section.

---

## 👥 User Management

This section is visible only to Admin users and allows team management during the pilot.

### Features

- **Invite by Email**  
  Admins can invite team members to join by entering their email address. If the user already exists but is not assigned to a company, they will be reactivated. If they belong to a different company, the invite is rejected.

- **View Role & Status**  
  See a list of all users in your company along with their role (Admin or Viewer).

- **Kick User**  
  Admins can remove users from the company. This revokes their access, but keeps their account in case you want to re-invite them later.
